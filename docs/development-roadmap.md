## ⚠️ Risk Management & Mitigation

### **Critical Risks & Mitigation Strategies**

#### **1. System Versioning Complexity (High Risk)**
**Risk**: MariaDB system versioning implementation issues  
**Impact**: Audit trail requirements not met, government compliance failure  
**Probability**: 30%  

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- ✅ Assign most experienced database developer
- ✅ Create prototype with sample data first
- ✅ Daily validation of audit trail functionality
- ✅ Backup plan: Manual audit logging if system versioning fails

**Early Warning Signs**: 
- Migration errors during development
- History table not populating correctly
- Performance issues with versioned queries

#### **2. Mobile Performance Issues (Medium Risk)**
**Risk**: 300ms response time requirement not met  
**Impact**: User experience degradation, functional requirement failure  
**Probability**: 25%  

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- ✅ Implement performance monitoring from Day 1
- ✅ Optimize database queries early
- ✅ Use React performance patterns (memoization, lazy loading)
- ✅ Test on actual mobile devices throughout development

**Early Warning Signs**:
- Task list loading >500ms consistently
- Mobile scroll performance issues
- Network timeout errors on mobile networks

#### **3. shadcn/ui Integration Challenges (Medium Risk)**
**Risk**: Component library complexity delays Story 1.4  
**Impact**: Timeline extension, UX inconsistency  
**Probability**: 20%  

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- ✅ Set up shadcn/ui in packages/ui during Phase 1
- ✅ Create component documentation early
- ✅ Validate responsive patterns before Story 1.4
- ✅ Fallback: Use simple HTML/CSS if shadcn blocks progress

**Early Warning Signs**:
- Component styling conflicts
- Mobile responsiveness issues with shadcn components
- Form validation not working properly

#### **4. Heroku Deployment Issues (Low-Medium Risk)**
**Risk**: Production deployment complexity  
**Impact**: Go-live delay, staging environment instability  
**Probability**: 15%  

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- ✅ Start with simple deployment configuration
- ✅ Validate staging environment daily
- ✅ Document all configuration steps
- ✅ Have rollback procedures ready
