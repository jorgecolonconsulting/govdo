### **Critical Risks & Mitigation Strategies**

#### **1. System Versioning Complexity (Previously High Risk) — ✅ RESOLVED**
**Original Risk**: MariaDB system versioning implementation issues  
**Status**: **SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED**  
**Resolution**: System versioning working correctly with proper audit trail

**What We Learned**:
- @@system_versioning_alter_history = 1 statement critical before doing ALTER to DROP SYSTEM VERSIONING
- Combined operations work better than separate statements

#### **2. Infrastructure Setup Complexity (Current Priority)**
**Risk**: Turborepo and Heroku deployment complexity  
**Impact**: Delays in UI development, staging environment unavailable  
**Probability**: 25%  

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- ✅ Database foundation complete to enable faster UI development
- 📋 Focus on minimal viable infrastructure setup
- 📋 Parallel development tracks reduce dependency risk
- 📋 Simple deployment configuration first, optimize later

**Early Warning Signs**: 
- Build configuration errors
- Deployment pipeline failures
- Package management conflicts

#### **3. Mobile Performance Issues (Medium Risk)**
**Risk**: 300ms response time requirement not met  
**Impact**: User experience degradation, functional requirement failure  
**Probability**: 25%  

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- ✅ Implement performance monitoring from Day 1
- ✅ Optimize database queries early
- ✅ Use React performance patterns (memoization, lazy loading)
- ✅ Test on actual mobile devices throughout development

**Early Warning Signs**:
- Task list loading >500ms consistently
- Mobile scroll performance issues
- Network timeout errors on mobile networks

#### **4. shadcn/ui Integration Challenges (Medium Risk)**
**Risk**: Component library complexity delays Story 1.4  
**Impact**: Timeline extension, UX inconsistency  
**Probability**: 20%  

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- ✅ Set up shadcn/ui in packages/ui during Phase 1
- ✅ Create component documentation early
- ✅ Validate responsive patterns before Story 1.4
- ✅ Fallback: Use simple HTML/CSS if shadcn blocks progress

**Early Warning Signs**:
- Component styling conflicts
- Mobile responsiveness issues with shadcn components
- Form validation not working properly

#### **5. Heroku Deployment Issues (Low-Medium Risk)**
**Risk**: Production deployment complexity  
**Impact**: Go-live delay, staging environment instability  
**Probability**: 15%  

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- ✅ Start with simple deployment configuration
- ✅ Validate staging environment daily
- ✅ Document all configuration steps
- ✅ Have rollback procedures ready
