## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas Identified

#### 1. **System Versioning Implementation (Story 1.2)**
- **Risk**: MariaDB system versioning complexity
- **Impact**: Audit trail requirements critical for government compliance
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Assign senior developer with database expertise
  - Prototype system versioning early
  - Validate with sample data before full implementation

#### 2. **Mobile UX Performance (Stories 1.3 & 1.4)**
- **Risk**: 300ms response time requirement on mobile
- **Impact**: User experience and functional requirements
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement performance monitoring from start
  - Use React optimization patterns (memoization, lazy loading)
  - Test on actual mobile devices early and often

#### 3. **shadcn/ui Integration (Story 1.4)**
- **Risk**: Component library integration complexity
- **Impact**: Consistent UI patterns and accessibility
- **Mitigation**:
  - Set up shadcn/ui in packages/ui first
  - Create component library documentation
  - Validate responsive patterns on mobile devices

### Medium-Risk Areas

#### 4. **Heroku Configuration (Story 1.1)**
- **Risk**: Deployment pipeline complexity
- **Impact**: Development velocity and testing ability
- **Mitigation**:
  - Start with simple deployment, iterate complexity
  - Document all configuration steps
  - Have rollback plan for deployment issues
